# Rusty Mathematica

## Introduction

Rusty Mathematica is an ambitious project aimed at interpreting and executing a subset of Mathematica syntax using the power and efficiency of Rust. The project's goal is to create a robust, high-performance interpreter that not only handles basic Mathematica computations but also supports custom function extensions. This opens the door to integrating Rust's capabilities with Mathematica's powerful computational tools.

## Goals

- **Parse and Interpret Mathematica Syntax**: Enable Rust to understand and execute a defined subset of Mathematica syntax.
- **Custom Functionality**: Extend the interpreter with custom Mathematica-like functions.
- **Optimization and Performance**: Leverage Rust's performance characteristics to optimize computational tasks.
- **Extensibility and Scalability**: Build the interpreter in a modular fashion to allow for easy expansion and improvement.

## Features

- **Mathematica Syntax Interpretation**: Interpret a subset of Mathematica syntax, focusing on arithmetic operations and basic functions.
- **Custom Functions**: Implement and support custom, user-defined functions within the Mathematica syntax.
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for syntax and runtime errors.
- **Optimized Performance**: Utilize Rust's efficiency to enhance performance, especially for heavy computations.

## Installation
